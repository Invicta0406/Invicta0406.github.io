<h1>Technology Risks</h1>

<p>Whilst this technology does a good job of answering almost any question, it poses serious problems when misused.</p>
<p>If precautionary measures aren’t considered or taken into effect, misuse could crumble the very foundation that schools are built upon.</p>
<p>For example, if a student were to sit an online math test, they could simply enter the question into OpenAI’s ChatGPT and receive not only the answer, but all the working out it took to get there in the first place if they so wanted to. This discredits the legitimate work that other students put in, ruining the exam.</p>
<p>Currently, schools aren't doing anything do remedy the risks we have presented. If computers are involved in a test per se, nobody is stopping a student from utilising this technology. Due to the risks of misuse, and the need for devices, what is stopping the technology from being misused?</p>
