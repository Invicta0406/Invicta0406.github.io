<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>


</ul>
<p>Students could use this technology in an appropriate manner by using it to generate inspiration, or simply paraphrasing their own writing to help with their learning of a particular topic or concept.</p>
<p>This technology can be misused by students however by generating essays or reports. A student could simply prompt ChatGPT with "write me an essay on Steam history, around 500 words", and it would begin to output exactly what was asked of it. If the student isn't happy with the essay, they can simply repeat the prompt and get an entirely different essay from ChatGPT</p> 
<p>Another way this technology could be misused by students is if they entered a prompt to answer a math or exam question. ChatGPT will take the question, answer it and show the student how it got to the answer in the first place, with a relatively high success rate.</p>
<p>There are many opportunities that we haven't even listed and that is only because the possibilities are endless due to the nature of these AI chatbots. Features are constantly being updated as time goes on and so, students will be able to take advantage of the many opportunities that the technology can offer.</p>
