<h1>Chosen Technology/Topic</h1>
	
<h5>Our topic that we chose for our research project is on Artificial Intelligence and the Consequences of Chatbot Usage in Schools, where we will touch base on how AI chatbots affect schooling and will continue to do so leading into the future.</h5>
<p>This is not just a problem we will have to face in New Zealand, since these chatbots are widely accessible worldwide, are advancing at a steady pace, and have gained notoriety for being able to complete almost any task you throw at it.</p>
<p>This technology can be used as a proper educational tool if handled properly, and there are currently many opportunities available to students due to the lack of control schools have on these AI chatbots.</p>
